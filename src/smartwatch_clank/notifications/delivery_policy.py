"""Durable activation policy for notification delivery.

One decision only: given a queued notification and the operator's configured
activation cutoff, may this row be sent now, or must it be *held*?

"Held" is not "failed". A held row keeps its payload, its attempt count and
its history; it is simply not eligible for this drain. That is what makes
turning delivery on for the first time safe: a discovery that predates
activation stays preserved instead of being flushed at a live channel the
moment a webhook URL appears.

Fail-closed is the rule in every ambiguous direction:

- A cutoff that is configured but unparseable holds everything. A policy we
  cannot read is never read as "send it all".
- A row whose discovery timestamp cannot be established (missing or
  unparseable `discovered_at`) is held whenever a cutoff is in force. We
  cannot prove it is newer than the cutoff, so we do not send it.

With no cutoff configured the pre-activation behaviour would send every
eligible pending row; activation (runbook: cutoff = NOW) is the deliberate
operator act that gates history, and this module only enforces whatever has
been chosen. Mirrors the fleet-proven feature-phone-clank delivery_policy.
