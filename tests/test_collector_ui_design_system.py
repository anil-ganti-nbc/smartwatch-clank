"""Collector UI design system v1 — conformance for Smartwatch Clank.

The six collector Clanks share one visual language by carrying a byte-identical
copy of dashboard/collector_ui.py (there is deliberately NO shared runtime
dependency: a copied module keeps every dashboard independently launchable and
survives PyInstaller unchanged).

These tests pin the parts that make the family read as one product, and the
anti-patterns the redesign removed. They do not assert pixel values.
